## Welcome to Orbitech.

A magic-technology mod aiming to bring immersive automation systems into Hytale.

With Orbitech, we aim to bring players a variety of tools, machinery, and energy systems to help them automate whatever their imagination desires in-game

Our priorities are to do all of this while ensuring a smooth and user-friendly experience for all players, regardless of their experience with similar mods or the intended use they have in mind. And of course, without forgetting that we are in the world of Orbis, so every feature is carefully thought out to feel natural and not out of place.

## Features

- Kinetic systems and machinery: Inspired in Create mod, we include rotational based powered machines and systems that will allow players to build freely around physical connections.
- Power system: Wired by copper, the energy system allows players to power different machines directly with power.
- Item management: Chutes, conveyor belts and NPCs, players will be able to manage their items automatically
- Use of magic energy as a power source: Orbis is world full of life and magic, we take advantage of it to power various machines and utilities to enhance player's experience
- Golem NPC's: With customizable behavior and task management, golems will allow players to program tasks, workflows and even roleplay with them if desired.
- Various magical multi-purpose utilities: Endless possibilities unlocked with magical devices and utilities

This mod is from the community, for the community. Let's all enjoy Hytale together. See you in Orbis!
