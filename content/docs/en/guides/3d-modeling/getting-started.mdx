Let's start with the basics of 3D Modeling.

## Download & Installing BlockBench

Hytale uses BlockBench for all 3D modeling tasks. You can download it from the official website: [BlockBench](https://www.blockbench.net/).

Once downloaded, follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

You can also use the [web version](https://web.blockbench.net/) of Blockbench if you prefer not to install anything, although this is not recommended for large/complicated models.
